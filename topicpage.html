    <p>When I grow up I want to be a psychiatrist, I want to be able to help people through the hard parts of their life.Although psychiatric training is a long and tough process, I think that it will be worth it if it means that I can help people get better. Psychiatry is almost the same as psychology, with the acception that psychologists are not qualified to prescribe medication to their patients. Some medication that psychiatrists are allowed to prescribe are antidepresssents, antipsychotics, sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, stabiliers (mood), and stimulants. Most of the time, medication is prescribed along with psychotheray. </p>

    <h4>Physciatric Training</h4>
    
    <p>Becoming a psychiatrist is a long process that includes taking 4 years of psychiatry training, not including extra years of training if they choose to want to have a specialty to their title. They must attend medical school and take a test for a license to practice medicine, and then four year of psychiatry residency. You first need a bachelors degree, a medical degree, complete the psychiatric residency, obtain your license to practice medicine, then become certified by the ABPN. </p>

    <h4>Pro's</h4>
    
    <p>Some pro's that I see out of becoming a psychiatrist are that I would be able to help people, the anual income of the average psychiatrist is good, an I could set up my own office and manage my own hours. Being able to help people is something that I like to do, and I'm always told that you should work at a job you like. Being able to help people makes me feel like a good person and it makes the world a little bit of a better place, more people have improved moods and feelings. As of last year, the average anual income of a psychiatrist was said to be $210,259. I want to have a wife and two kids, and with this income it will be easier to provide for my family and I'll be able to give my wife and kids a good life. </p>

    <h4> Con's </h4>
    
    <p>Some con's that can come out of being a psychiatrist are the cost for schooling, the intensity of the competition in schooling, and the toll that being a psychiatrist takes on you. Medical school is expensive, but the cost can vary according to which school you choose to attend. Also, once you're in medical school every student is reaching towards the same goal, and everyone is paying the same amoun of money and nobody is willing to waste that money. Finally, the toll that psychiatry takes on somebody is more mental than anything. Listening to other people's problems all day with no help for yourself really effects somebody. </p>
