    <p>Psychiatry is almost the same as psychology, with the acception that psychologists are not qualified to prescribe medication to their patients. Some medication that psychiatrists are allowed to prescribe are antidepresssents, antipsychotics, sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, stabiliers (mood), and stimulants. Most of the time, medication is prescribed along with psychotheray. </p>

    <h4>Physciatric Training</h4>
    
    <p>Becoming a psychiatrist is a long process that includes taking 4 years of psychiatry training, not including extra years of training if they choose to want to have a specialty to their title. They must attend medical school and take a test for a license to practice medicine, and then four year of psychiatry residency. You first need a bachelors degree, a medical degree, complete the psychiatric residency, obtain your license to practice medicine, then become certified by the ABPN. </p>

    <h4>Mid Life</h4>
    
    <p>After my parents divorce me and my full brothers primarily live with my mom and would go to my dads house every other weekend. I was still playing baseball around this time (10-12) and I was really seeing improvement. By this point I was playing baseball because I had enjoyed it, not because my parents made me, I was given a choice. By choosing to continue to play baseball I knew it would also mean continuing to manage good grades meanwhile on a busy practice schedule, although it was tough I managed. The first year of middle school was sort of tough, but because I was trying to adjust to all the changes going on in my life. Once in seventh grade I had gotten used to things and that's when I had started to settle in. But once again, things had started to change, my dad was getting married again. After his second marriage my dad had another child, a daughter, then two years later, a son. He and his new wife went through a bit of a rough patch but worked it out and are fine now. </p>

    <h4> Future </h4>
    
    <p>In the future I want to continue to run cross country throughout high school and play baseball throughout high school. Post high school the sport that I'd like to focus on is baseball, even if I won't be able to go professional, I'd like to at least play throughout college. Once in college I'd like to take courses on psychology and psychiatry, I want to be able to help people with their problems. If I become a psychiatrist or psychologist I wouldn't prescribe medication unless absolutely necessary, I know that most of the time pills only make the situation worse. I do not want to attend a college in California, I want to go out of state so that I can have chances to see new things and meet new people. </p>
