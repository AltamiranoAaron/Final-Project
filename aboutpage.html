    <p> A couple things about me are that I am 14 going on 15, in the 9th grade, and I'm a guy. I like to play baseball and I've been playing all my life, for the other sport that I do, cross country, I just started last school year and chose to continue running this year. I don't necessarily enjoy running most times, but I do like the competition during meets, racing against others. For cross country practice I enjoy sometimes because some of the routes we take have a nice view and also I get to run with my friends and sometimes we'd have conversations. For baseball, I was sort of born into it but I started to enjoy it, that's why I still play now. My older brother, dad, grandpa, and all my uncles on my dads side all played baseball for at least a year of their lives. My parents are both in their mid 30's, my mom has three children and my dad has five. Me and my full blood brothers are all 3 years apart, and I am 11 years older than my half siblings. </p>

    <h4> Early life</h4>
    
    <p> When I was about 6 or 7, my parents got a divorce and split up. My mom gained primary custody of my two full brothers and I. I used to live in La Puente, but my mom had decided to sell our house and then we moved to West Covina. In fourth grade I started to attend an elementary school in West Covina, little did I know that here is where I'd meet some of my best friends. Two of my best friends from that elementary school had moved on to junior high with me, meanwhile one had to be homeschooled due to a knee injury disabling him of being able to walk around a lot. We had remained friends throughout junior high and finally highschool came and we were reunited. </p>

    <h4>Mid Life</h4>
    
    <p>After my parents divorce me and my full brothers primarily live with my mom and would go to my dads house every other weekend. I was still playing baseball around this time (10-12) and I was really seeing improvement. By this point I was playing baseball because I had enjoyed it, not because my parents made me, I was given a choice. By choosing to continue to play baseball I knew it would also mean continuing to manage good grades meanwhile on a busy practice schedule, although it was tough I managed. The first year of middle school was sort of tough, but because I was trying to adjust to all the changes going on in my life. Once in seventh grade I had gotten used to things and that's when I had started to settle in. But once again, things had started to change, my dad was getting married again. After his second marriage my dad had another child, a daughter, then two years later, a son. He and his new wife went through a bit of a rough patch but worked it out and are fine now. </p>

    <h4> Future </h4>
    
    <p>In the future I want to continue to run cross country throughout high school and play baseball throughout high school. Post high school the sport that I'd like to focus on is baseball, even if I won't be able to go professional, I'd like to at least play throughout college. Once in college I'd like to take courses on psychology and psychiatry, I want to be able to help people with their problems. If I become a psychiatrist or psychologist I wouldn't prescribe medication unless absolutely necessary, I know that most of the time pills only make the situation worse. I do not want to attend a college in California, I want to go out of state so that I can have chances to see new things and meet new people. </p>
